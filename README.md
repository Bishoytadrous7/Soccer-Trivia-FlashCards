# ⚽ Soccer Trivia Flashcards

An interactive web app that quizzes users on soccer knowledge using flashcards. It features a bank of 100+ questions categorized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). Users can test themselves, shuffle through questions, skip and return to them later, and mark cards as “mastered” to avoid repetition. The app also tracks your current streak and longest streak.
